Growing up I always loved physics, because of its ability to explain the natural world. Eventually I fell in love with geology because of it's unexplained problems and requirement for creative thinking. Recently, I've stumbled into the world of data science and deep learning where all the joys I found in geology and physics seem to collide into one over-arching field. I've spent my career studying large geologic, geophysical, and environmental data set. Now I've started honing my data manipulation and modeling skills to catch up with my intuitions.

This blog will serve as my personal outlet as I continue to learn more python, data modeling, and visualization.
