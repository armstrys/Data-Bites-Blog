I've spent my career studying geology and physics and have a passion for understanding the cause of natural phenomena. I have lots of experience looking at large data sets - seismic, gravity, magnetics, electromagnetics, and miscellaneous subsurface geologic data. Most of these projects have been done in MATLAB and ArcGIS. More recently I've started honing data science skills to bring my intuitions about data exploration and data analysis into the world of machine learning and replicable data science using python frameworks and git.

My current role is as a GOM exploration geophysicist for Hess Corporation in Houston, TX, but my past experiences have been varied. Below are a few of my past roles:

* Past Experiences at Hess
    * Building workflows for cataloging well-based seismic amplitude analysis at a regional scale - Gulf of Mexico, USA
    * Stratigraphic mapping of regional shallow hazards - Tano Basin, Ghana
    * Basin Scale Play Evaluation for New Ventures - Atlantic Margins (Ireland, Brazil, Sierra Leone, South Africa, Mauritania, Senegal)
    * Prospect analysis and well planning - Offshore Newfoundland, CA
* Reserseach Assistant - University of Wyoming
    * Processing and interpretation of airborne electromagnetic survey - Snowy Range, WY
    * Geophysical data collection (Seismic refraction, ERT, GPR, Magnetics, NMR) - WY and CA
* IRIS internship (and senior thesis) - Research at UW - Madison (thesis at Colorado College)
