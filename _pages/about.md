I'm a geoscientist by background with a strong desire to uncover the "why" of challenging problems. I've spend my career studying geologic, geophysical, and environmental data, but spend much of my free time trolling through other publicly available data. 

As I continue to learn more python and vizualization skills I will be sharing my learnings and insights here on this blog. Please visit [this page](https://rysarmstr.github.io/Data-Bites-Blog/jupyter/2020/04/25/Introduction.html#Where-in-the-world?) or visit [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rysarmstr/) for more details on my background in geoscience and physics.
