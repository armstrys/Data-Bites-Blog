"Christchurch, New Zealand",-43.523673,172.584118,Remote Study,"In 2011 I attended field camp in New Zealand and my study abroad in Christchurch was cut short by the 2011 Canterbury Earthquake. The following summer I studied the Canterbury region to identify repeating earthquakes within the aftershock sequence, which ultimately became my senior thesis at Colorado College."
